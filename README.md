Due to the significance of sports in our lives, it is crucial for us to engage in them with proper technique. This project focuses on object detection as its primary objective, followed by storing the captured images or videos in a database for further analysis. Furthermore, it aims to assess basketball poses, postures, and shots. The proposed basketball posture action recognition and analysis system consists of two components. The initial component employs a bottom-up posture estimation method to identify joint points and extract the sequence of postures from the target images or videos. The second component involves analyzing and researching action recognition algorithms utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and YOLO, with additional assistance from the OpenPose library to enhance result accuracy. The intention is to improve playersâ€™ muscle memory and enhance their skills by obtaining more precise movements. Moreover, the basketball data analysis system also provides valuable insights for coaches and athletes.
